# WebScraping
My first steps in web scraping using bs4 (BeautifulSoup) library on python. This one only allows you to scrap wallpapers from an hardcoded website.
It allows you to download every wallpaper providing a keyword like 'landscape' or 'star wars' (or iterates on a list of keywords written in a .txt file).
It iterates over all pages of the given keyword.

There is two branches: main is the CLI version with a simple user input to type the keyword you want and the number of pages you want to scrap.

USAGE:

main branch: (make sure to create an environment with all requirements) just run  'python WebSiteScraping.py'
GTK branch: (it gives you a very basic User Interface): run the command 'python _GTK_MainWindow.py'
